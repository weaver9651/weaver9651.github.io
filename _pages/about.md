I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at The Pennsylvania State University, advised by [Dr. Dinghao Wu](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/wu/). My research interests lie in software and systems security, particularly in binary analysis, 
reassembling disassembly, and secure binary transformation. I am currently working on the [Uroboros](https://github.com/s3team/uroboros) project, a framework for reassembleable disassembling and transformation. My recent focus includes enhancing ARM architecture support.  
Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a backend developer at NAVER, where I gained experience in scalable system design and service infrastructure.  
Iâ€™m always interested in new research problems and collaboration opportunities in software security, program analysis, and compiler-based defenses.
