Nowadays cloud computing technology is used for a variety of services, such as the internet of things and artificial intelligence. However, as more data is being processed in the cloud, there is growing concern about security issues in the cloud computing environment. To solve this concern, many studies have been conducted to ensure the integrity of virtual machines in a cloud computing environment. However, in the case of the control-flow integrity for the virtual machine, existing studies are not only necessary to modify the kernel code, but also cannot protect it efficiently. In this paper, we propose VM-CFI which efficiently protects the control-flow integrity of VM kernel without modification of VM kernel in cloud computing environment. For this purpose, VM-CFI utilizes Processor Trace (PT), a hardware feature that is recently supported by Intel architecture. According to the experimental results, VM-CFI incurs on average 4.2% overhead.
